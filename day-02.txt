         In Javascript, both the 'document' and 'window' objects are fundamental parts of the browser environment,
         but they serve different purposes.

     * Introduction Of document and window:

           1. Window object: It represents the browser window that contains the DOM(Document Object Model).
              The 'window' objects is the global objects in client-side JavaScript,meaning that it's
              always available and properties and methods can be accessed without explicity stating 'window'.
              It represents the browser's viewport and provides properties and methods for controlling the browser 
              window.Some common properties and methoda of the 'window' object include 'window.innerWidth','window.innner-
              Height','window.location',window.alert()','window.setTimeout()',etc.

           2. Document object: It represents the HTML document loaded in the browser window.The 'document' object is a 
              property of the 'window' object and serves as an entry point to access the content of the web page.It provides 
              properties and methods to interact with the HTML elements and manipulate the DOM tree.Some Common properties and methods 
              of the 'document' object include 'document.ElementByID()','document.querySelector()','document.createElement()',
              'document.body'.'document.title',etc.

     * Difference between document and window:


                 *** document ***                                                     *** window *** 
  
   
           1. It represents any HTML document or web page that is                1. It represents a browser window or frame that displays the 
              loaded in the browser.                                                contents of the webpage.

           2. It is loaded inside the window.                                    2. It is the very first object that is loaded in the browser.

           3. It is the object of window property.                               3. It is the object of the browser.

           4. All the tags, elements with attributes in HTML are                 4. Global objects, functions, and variables of JavaScript are 
              part of the document.                                                 members of the window object.

           5. We can access the document from a window using the                 5. We can access the window from the window only. i.e. window.window.
              window. document.

           6. The document is part of BOM (browser object model) and             6. The window is part of BOM, not DOM.
              dom (Document object model).

           7. Properties of document objects such as title, body, cookies,       7. Properties of the window object cannot be accessed by the document object.
              etc can also be accessed by a window like this window. 
              document.title.

           8. syntax: document.propertyname;                                     8. syntax: window.propertyname;
